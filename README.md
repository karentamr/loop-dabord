# README for Web-Based Pedal Looper Application

## Welcome Aboard! ðŸŽ¶
Hello! I'm thrilled to present my first significant project: a web-based pedal looper application. This journey into web development and audio manipulation has been both challenging and rewarding, and I'm eager to share the results of my hard work and learning.

## About the Project
This application is a creative tool for musicians and audio enthusiasts, designed to be intuitive and fun. It allows you to record, manipulate, and play audio loops directly in your browser, perfect for experimenting with melodies, rhythms, or any sound that strikes your fancy.

### Features at a Glance
- **Looping Made Easy**: Record, play, and delete audio loops without a hitch.
- **Tune It Your Way**: Adjustable master loop length and speed for perfect synchronization.
- **Visuals & Timing**: Waveform display and a custom scheduler (using React and Howler.js) for precise audio control.
- **Crossfade Effects**: Customize your audio transitions for seamless playback.
- **Choose Your Input**: Select from different live audio inputs for recording.
- **Metronome Included**: Keep your rhythms in check with an integrated metronome.
- **Save & Retrieve**: Securely save your loops in MongoDB and access them anytime.
- **User-Friendly Authentication**: Easy and secure login using Auth0.

### Built With
- **React**: For building a dynamic user interface.
- **Styled-components**: Adding a bit of flair to the UI.
- **Howler.js & Web Audio API**: The core of audio processing.
- **MongoDB**: For storing loop data and user profiles.

### Learning and Challenges
- **Timing Quirks**: I encountered some timing issues along the way and learned that React's `useEffect` isn't ideal for tight timing control. It was a valuable lesson in the limitations and proper use of certain tools and libraries.

## Getting Started
Interested in exploring or using the application? Here's how to get it up and running:

1. **Clone the Repository**: `git clone [repository-url]`
2. **Install Dependencies**: Navigate to the project directory and execute `npm install`.
3. **Launch the Application**: Run `npm start` and start your audio adventure!

## How to Use
- **Recording**: Click the record button to start and stop recording loops.
- **Loop Management**: Play, pause, and delete loops easily.
- **Volume Adjustment**: Fine-tune your sound with the volume slider.
- **Persistence**: Save your loops with custom names and load them from your profile whenever you need.

## A Note from the Developer
As my first major foray into web development, this project has been a journey of discovery, challenges, and growth. I've learned a lot about the intricacies of audio processing and the limitations of certain technologies, like timing issues with React's `useEffect`. It's been a humbling and enriching experience, and I hope this application inspires and brings joy to those who use it.

I'm always open to feedback and suggestions, as they help me grow and improve. Feel free to reach out if you have any thoughts, questions, or just want to chat about the project.
